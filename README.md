convoluted mess for reducing astronomical light, bias, dark, and flat frames into final images.

Either run the program directly from the zip file by running

```bash
$ python reducer.zip
```

or run it in the directory by running

```bash
$ python __main__.py
```

It will do the same thing either way.
