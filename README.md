I've only tested this on Mac OSX 10.9 and 10.11 and some versions of Ubuntu that I can't remember the numbers of. This probably doesn't work on Windows due to the fact that it is atrociously written, and uses a lot of kinda unreliable methods to get things done that may or may not be dependent on *nix operating systems. Use at your own risk. It might fail. I'll add some comments later once I remember what the heck I was thinking when I wrote it.

Convoluted mess for reducing astronomical light, bias, dark, and flat frames into final images.

Either run the program directly from the zip file by running

```bash
$ python reducer.zip
```

or run it in the directory by running

```bash
$ python __main__.py
```

It will do the same thing either way.
